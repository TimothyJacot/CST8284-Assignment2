# CST8284-Assignment2
Please refer to README.md file for project description.

This is my CST8284 Assignment #2 for my Object-Oriented Programming Java course.

In this assignment, I implemented a GUI to create flammable or toxic drums.

I took an initiative in adding custom caracteristics on each drum created, 
eg: the picture provided shows different flashpoints, contents, etc. for each drum. 

I thought it would add a certain uniqueness to the project that wasn't required from the assignment deliverables.
